            <div id="content">This video is my own video I posted up on YouTube back in highschool for my
                debate class project. We were currently working on convincing or influencing 
                someone to get people on your side of a debate. So for our project we decided
                to do an advertisement for a hat called the "Jeek hat." We used the three main 
                components in a speech: ethos, logos, and pathos. Ethos or ethical appeal, we 
                were kids who owned the hat and designed the hat. Logos or logical appeal, we 
                used "numbers" like how much jeek hats were sold in a single year. Pathos or
                emotional appeal, we used people who owned the hat and asked how they felt
                about it. Now that I look back on the video I think we could've done a better
                job like create fake sales graphs to hit on the logical appeal and have a 
                "US President" talk about the hat for ethical appeal. But we didn't have much 
                time and didn't have too many ideas at the time. All of the video was solely
                improv with using ethos, logos, and pathos as our main focus. So tell me how 
                you think we did as a group. Please critique the video and tell us how we 
                could have done better or if you liked or disliked the video. Go to my 
                YouTube channel DLOLFactor to watch some more of my school projects and like 
                and subscribe.
